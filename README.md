# mazegenerator.app

This site is an online maze generator app, that is built using my [maze_generator](https://github.com/thewizardbear/maze_generator) Javascript module. The basic design is taken from [rainbowmazes.com](https://rainbowmazes.com).

## Todo

* "can I improve tooltip accessiblity? maybe with aria-live and javascript setting innerHTML?"
* "should I be using label elements?"
* More download options:
  * jpg
  * svg
  * gif
  * pdf
  * mp4
* dark and light mode
* better responsiveness (for large screens)
* better sidebar pull-out button
